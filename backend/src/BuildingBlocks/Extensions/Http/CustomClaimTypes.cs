/// A centralized collection of custom claim type constants used throughout the authentication and authorization system.
/// 
/// This class defines standardized keys for accessing claim values (such as user ID, email, role, etc.)
/// from a JWT token or ClaimsPrincipal object. By storing them here, we avoid magic strings scattered across the codebase,
/// improve maintainability, and reduce the chance of typos or inconsistencies.
///
/// Notes:
/// - Standard role claim is mapped to the well-known URI-based format.
/// - Ensure consistency with the claims generated during token issuance in your Identity system.
